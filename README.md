# Project Title : Generate A Professional ReadMe
## Project Description:
Often times people struggle with what to add to their ReadMe file. This easy to use application works to solve that problem. The user will be prompted with questions or statements that requires an input. Once the user has completed the "questionaire" his/hers ReadMe file will be changed to incorporate the answers provided. The user then can review said changes then push to Github.
